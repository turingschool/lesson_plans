# How-to How-to

Today we will practice our active reading skills. We will split into groups and read a ReadMe doc from a gem or you can read Rails Documentation about something that you want to learn more about. Then we will split into yet other small groups and teach each other what we learned from the reading.

### Tips

While reading docs and ReadMes there are many different techniques and strategies you can utilize in order to make your attempt to figure things out more efficient and a little less painful.

* Preview the --whole-- page. Go ahead and glance through the doc and get your head some context before you dive in head first.
* Like when you learn a new language - be patient - read things thoroughly and with purpose - and if you come to something you don't understand don't dwell on it too much, it will probably be cleared up in the rest of the doc.
* If something in particular is still very unclear. Look that thing up.
* Use the find (command-f) in the browser to find the specific thing you are looking for. You may need this to quickly jump to a the section you're looking for or you may want to look for other instances of that particular word or phrase so you can define its meaning to you or expand upon it or find an example.
* Take Notes - Write things down. If you interact with more than one of your senses you will tend to remember things better and if nothing else you will have a reference to what you had already learned without spending the time to look it up again.
* Along the lines of taking notes - Summarize. Summarize everything you learning so you can be sure you understand what it is you just tried to learn.
* Dive into the code base. I know, I know - how could you possibly read the code base of something so advanced and intimidating as a gem or even rails itself?!? It's really not that bad and will often be able to really clarify what is happening.
