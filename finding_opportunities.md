# Finding New Opportunities

## Learning Competencies
- Research companies and people to create a list of opportunities
- Redefine how best to find job opportunities without limiting search to job boards or job listings
- Demonstrate healthy job searching strategies to include: Meetup, LinkedIn, cold outreach, boolean searches to produce more potential opportunities

## Summary

Looking for jobs on sites like monster.com, Indeed, and other career listing sites can be discouraging and ineffective. Let’s talk about how to find a job without relying on your resume or job postings. 

- Check out the [Finding New Opportunities's](INSERTLINK) slide deck for more research support.

## Objectives

Focus on finding companies and people you'd like to work with or for, don't get side track with whether or not they have job listings posted that match your skillset. The goal is to think long term. Some of these opportunities may turn into future opportunities, rather than your first job. Be open-minded because you never know what will come of these conversations you'll start having.

## Meetup Differently

Meetup is traditionally used to find local networking groups. However, it can also be used to find companies you would like to work with. 

### Your Turn

- Navigate to Meetup.com
- Search for groups local to the area you’re interested in working (i.e. ruby, javascript, etc.), be sure to select groups.
- On the group page two things will be very useful to the search: the **Organizers** list and the upcoming events.
- Check out who the organizers are. Where do they work? What other meetups are they active in? Are any of these companies of interest?
- Now navigate to the **RSVP** list. Who else is going? What companies do they work for? These are great resources for finding companies that you may be interested in working for that you may not have known before!

## LinkedIn Actively
It's not enough to just have a profile and hope employers find you. Use LinkedIn to learn more about people using similar skills to those you'd like to use in your career or find people with the working titles you'd like to have, living in the location you'd like to be living and working in, and working in the industry you'd like to be working in.

### Your Turn

- Navigate to [LinkedIn.com](http://linkedin.com)
- Use the "Advanced Search" tool to find people based on skillset, location, and industry. 
- In "Keywords" type in the skills or focus you want to be working in (i.e. JavaScript, ruby, digital nomad, edtech, fintech etc.)
- In "Location" type in the area you'd like to be working it, whether it is where you're located or not.
- In "Industry" select "computer software" 
- Select search
- Of those profiles that return, look at their profiles to see the list of companies they've worked for throughout their experience. 
- Add those companies of interest to your company tracker, include the person(s) you believe you could build a relationship with at those companies.


## LinkedIn Company Connections
If you already have companies in mind that you would like to work with/for, don't just apply to an open position, *if* there is an open position. Find someone at the company that you believe you could build a relationship with and ask for an informational interview to learn more about the company culture, team dynamics, and work flow.

### Your Turn

- Navigate to [LinkedIn.com](http://linkedin.com)
- Search for people to connect with that work for companies you’re interested in by typing the search box the name of the company. As you type a drop down selection of “People who work at…” will appear. Select that option.
- Narrow it down by the location where you’d like to work.
- Then narrow it down by industry - computer software.
- Now click through the results and determine whom you feel you can build a relationship with. When you find one, research them.
- When you feel like you know what you need to, write a personalized connection message to them with a call to action.
- You can also click on the company’s page and in the bottom right corner click: “People Also Viewed…” to find companies similar to this company.

## Google... because it's that obvious
Often job seekers forget to Google the simplest of searches. Don't forget to research event he simplest of phrases.

- Navigate to [Google](http://google.com)
- Pick a location you’re interested in exploring opportunities.
- Search “top tech companies in [location]” / "top workplaces in [industry (edtech, fintech, etc.)]"
- Look for a journalist-generated list of companies that are recommended in that area.
- Pick a couple companies to look into with the students.
- Walk through the about page, careers page, and team page
- Research these people on LinkedIn, Twitter, and look for a personal blog by this person/people
- Evaluate how you could build a connection with someone from that company

## Track Your Research
Keep this information somewhere to stay organized as you reach out to companies and people.

- Add companies to your trello icebox
- Include the contact information for the individual you would like to build a connection with / have an informational interview with
- Track the communication between you and the individual(s) at the company
- Track the stage of the process you are currently in with the company
