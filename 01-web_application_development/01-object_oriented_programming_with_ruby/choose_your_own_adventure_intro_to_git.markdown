## Choose Your Own Adventure Intro to Git

Today, we're going to introduce **[git](https://git-scm.com/)**, a distributed
version control system popular with many software developers.

Git is a large system with a lot of specialized features,
but for now we'd like to focus on 2 things:

1. Developing a basic conceptual model of how git works
2. Developing a practical, easy-to-execute workflow for using
git on a day-to-day basis

#### Goals

Students should be able to:

* explain the purpose of Git
* initialize a new git repository
* add files to git staging area
* commit files and directories
* check the status of the working directory and staging area and interpret the output
* create and checkout a new branch
* switch between branches
* merge local branches to local master
* explain the purpose of Github
* clone a repository from Github
* create a remote on Github
* push a repository to Github from the command line

## Getting Started - Git's Conceptual Model (90 mins)

First, let's spend **90 minutes** getting some overview and background
on Git, as well as some introductory hands-on practice.
Choose **one of the following** independent activities to work on.

#### Level 1 - Drills and Guided Practice (Video + Exercises)

Ease in with Code School's free [Git Real Course](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/git-real).
This contains some good introductory videos as well as some guided
challenges to give you some practice with the basic git commands.

Try to get through level 3. You may be able to get farther if you
work quickly.

#### Level 2 - Intermediate Overview and Command-Line Practice

Scott Chacon's book [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is available
free on the Git website. This book is a little denser but still gives
a great introduction to both the concepts behind git and its basic practical
application.

Read and work through the examples in the following sections:

* [1.1 - Intro](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control)
* [1.2 - Short History](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-A-Short-History-of-Git)
* [1.3 - Git Basics](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics)
* [1.6 - Setup](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup)
* [2.1 - Creating a Repository](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository)
* [2.2 - Recording Changes](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository)
* [2.3 - Viewing History](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Viewing-the-Commit-History)
* [2.5 - Working with Remotes](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Working-with-Remotes)

Strive to complete at least through section 2.2.

#### Level 3 - Conceptual Deep Dive and Discussion (Video)

[Source Control Made Easy with Jim Weirich](https://pragprog.com/screencast/v-jwsceasy/source-control-made-easy)

If you like working with deeper conceptual understandings, or if you already have
some experience with git, this video by Jim Weirich gives a fascinating look
at the conceptual underpinnings behind git.

The video approaches git from the perspective of trying to build a hypothetical
Version Control System (VCS) and discussing many of the issues and concepts involved.

(Turing owns a copy of the video which we will screen for the class)

## Next Steps -- Practical Git Workflows (90 mins)

Now that we have some conceptual understandings and a bit of practice under our
belts, lets talk about a practical workflow that we can apply to our own projects.

We'll pick up with the [Basic Git Workflow](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_01-object_oriented_programming_with_ruby/intro_to_git.markdown#a-basic-git-workflow)
section of this lesson plan.
