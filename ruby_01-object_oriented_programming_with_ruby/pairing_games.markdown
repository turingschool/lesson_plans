# Pairing Games

## Materials

Before the lesson the instructor needs to:

* Print one copy of [the pdf](http://www.acphd.org/media/271383/barnga_instructions.pdf) per person in a group (ie, groups of 4 means 4 copies)
* Cut and organize those print outs
* Gather and prepare the playing cards, one deck per group, following the instructions in the PDF

## Orchestration

* Break the students into X groups
* Distribute one set of instructions per group
* Distribute one filtered deck of cards per group
* Explain that we're going to play some games to learn about and experiment with group roles, norms, and expectations.

### Playset 1

* Tell them they have 5 minutes to play and to follow the printed instructions.
* After 60 seconds tell them to "freeze" their bodies and ask:
  * Look at the group's body language. Who is "open"? Who is "removed" or set back from the group?
  * Point to the person in the group who touched the cards first
  * Point to the person in the group who has said the most words
  * Then go
* After a total of 4 minutes, tell them that "Speed is important. Play as quickly as you can."
* After a total of 5 minutes, tell them to freeze.
* Tell them to pile up their instruction sheets within the group

### Playset 2

* Tell them to continue playing in complete silence for 5 minutes, still as fast as they can. Gestures are ok.
* Go around the room and collect the instruction sheets while they're playing
* After three minutes tell them to freeze:
  * Point to the person who's made the most gestures
  * Point to the person who's made the most noise
  * Point to the person who plays the slowest
  * Point to the person who plays the fastest
* Let them continue play for 2 more minutes
* Tell them to freeze
  * Point to the person who has won the most hands
  * That person should raise their hand
  * If there's a tie, pick the person with the later first name in alphabetical order
  * Have that person rotate one group clockwise
* Resume play for 3 more minutes

### Playset 3

* Tell them to freeze:
  * Point to the person who's having the most fun
  * Point to the person who's hating this the most
  * Point to the person who has lost the most hands
  * That person should raise their hand
  * If there's a tie, pick the person with the earlier first name in alphabetical order
  * Have that person rotate one group counter-clockwise

### Playset 4

* Tell them "this is the final lightning round. Play as fast as you can and the person with the most hands won will be the champion." Tell them it'll go for 5 minutes.
* After three minutes tell them to freeze.
  * Push all your cards into a pile
  * "Just kidding -- in collaboration there are no winners and losers"
  * Come back to your seats

### Discussion

Call a random student by name for each question:

* Did you enjoy the exercise?
* What did you notice about the game?
* What was the most fun?
* What was the most frustrating?
* What did you notice about the people in your group?
* What did you notice about yourself?
* When you saw we were playing a card game, what did you feel? What kind of expectations did you have?
* When people rotated, what did that tell you about expectations?

Thinking about your self, project, and project pair:

* What expectations do you have for yourself with relation to the project?
* What do you expect from your pair?
* What does your pair expect from you?
* What did you do to align expectations?
* How well are expectations being fulfilled?
* What can we do better next time to align expectations?
* What can we do to improve the current project working relationship?
