# How Ruby Works

Let's set a bit of context by discussing how your Ruby programs actually run on the computer. Let's discuss:

* Hardware resources (CPU, memory, accessories, network)
* Operating systems (ex: Windows and Unix/MacOS)
* File systems in Windows and Unix/MacOS
* Processes
* The Ruby "Virtual Machine"
* Virtual machines & cross-operating system compatibility
* The OS X Terminal
* Running multiple processes (and virtual machines)
* In-Memory storage vs File System storage
* Running `irb` vs `ruby`
