# Module 1 Goals, Expected Beginnings, and Technical Proficiencies

## Expected Beginnings

When this module begins we expect students to:

* have completed the Ruby-centric pre-work such as Pragmatic Studio's Ruby course and/or the Tealeaf Academy prep program
* developed a typing proficiency for code of at least 20 wpm using tools such as http://typing.io
* be equipped with a Macbook running bash, Homebrew, Atom, XCode, RVM, and Ruby 2.2 (or greater)

## Goals

A student who graduates from this module will have developed:

* Fundamental understandings of Ruby syntax (*Syntax*)
* An ability to decompose complex technical challenges into a series of smaller challenges (*Problem Decomposition*)
* The skills to build software using automated tests, pseudocode, implementation code, and refactoring (*Building Solutions*)
* Basic understandings of how and why software is executed on a computer (*Under the Hood*)
* Skills and procedures for effectively collaborating and pairing with other developers (*Collaboration*)
* Foundational understandings about the culture, style, strengths, and weaknesses of working in the "tech world" (*Culture*)

## Technical Proficiencies

* create a Ruby program using the principles of Object-Oriented Programming.
* critique code in a specific, actionable, and kind way.
* demonstrate how to use GitHub for projects.
* create software tests that will drive the design of applications.
* assemble and track tasks using a project management tool.
* explain how basic data structures work and implement them in Ruby.
* compose Ruby programs that manipulate objects using complex algorithms.
* implement an object relational model.
* collaborate effectively with teammates.
