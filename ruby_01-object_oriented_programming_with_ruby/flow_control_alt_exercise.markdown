### Assignment

Spend 20 minutes working on the first challenge. Implement the solution twice, using 2 of the following looping tools:

* `each`
* `for` loop
* `while` loop

Then spend 5 - 10 minutes recapping and sharing solutions for that exercise

Next spend 30 minutes working on the second challenge. Again, implement it twice using 2 of the available looping techniques.
