# Social Fellowship: Roots Project

## The Project

The purpose of the social fellowship is to work on software needed for a non-profit. On this first iteration, we are working with Roots Elementary, a public charter school that is transforming education for low-income families in Denver.

Students are expected to work 24 hours a week. Mode Set will provide 8 hours of technical leadership. Roots will work with students to define priorities and features.

At the end, participants will have the opportunity to get a recommendation letter from Mode Set and Roots upon succesful completion of the project.

### Pre-Work

You'll be expected to have reviewed the following materials by Monday.

- Reach out to the existing Social Fellowship team with your Github username, email that you use on Heroku, etc to get set up with the tracking software/repo access, etc
- Review all materials available on the project, including notes
- Research the company you'll be working for and with
- Review the proposed tech stack.

## Requirements

### Blog Posts

Since this project is being run like a consulting project, the emphasis is to get work done _well_. A big part of the project will be documenting our travels. One of the goals of this project is strengthen your portfolio and there is no better way to do that than to showcase your expertise in an area that not may other people know about. In addition to programming, you'll be writing a blog post on the features you choose to implement or research.

**Important Note**: It's easy to complain how stuff is hard in a blog post. Not only is that not particularly helpful to anyone who reads your post, it turns out that most open source software is created by humans and humans have a tendency to feel really bad when you complain about their donated efforts.

### Daily Stand Ups
Each story will have acceptance criteria which must be met. Inclusive in that criteria is attending and discussing where you are at with the team in a daily standup. We will hold our stand ups daily, before classes start in the afternoon, so come prepared to give examples and speak for at least 5 minutes about what you have accomplished.

### Pull Requests

You will be expected to work in a pull request process on your code and within your team. All major work should be pull requested in to your repo and you should expect to tag relevant mentors/students and drop PRs in slack. You will need at least one teammate to 'approve' your PR before you merge it.

You should expect to spend some time reviewing pull requests of others - a good metric is to select a PR a day to look over in depth from other teammates.

### Tracking hours

Students will be expected to track their hours in Harvest on a daily basis. Aim to complete 8 working hours per work day (times are flexible). Self study and classes that you attend count towards your 8 daily hours (as long as it is relevant to the work you're doing).
