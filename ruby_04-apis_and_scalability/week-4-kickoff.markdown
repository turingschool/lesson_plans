# An Overview

During Weeks 4 & 5, the class will split into three to four teams.

Today we'll talk about the options and give you a survey to select your first and second choice options for what you'd like to work on.

On **Friday of Week 4**, we'll evaluate your progress and decide together if you should continue working or move to a different project for Week 5.

Each project has it's own set of weekend research/pre-work - but should not exceed 1 to 3 hours.

# Your Next Steps

  - Read the descriptions and fine print below
  - Complete [This Survey](http://goo.gl/forms/CRJzLi9u4rzpYlik2) no later than ***10am Friday***
  - Once you are assigned a working group, you'll receive relevant pre-work to be completed no later than ***9am Tuesday***

# Basic Descriptions

### BoxTrot

- **What You’ll Do:** Work like a consulting team picking up stories on an existing [Rails app](https://github.com/LookingForMe/lookingfor) that's been built out by module 4 over the last three classes. The application collects information on job postings relevant to Turing students.
- **Good Option For:** Folks who want more production style experience. Folks targeting Rails jobs. Folks interested in learning about Agile workflow, optimizing backend Rails. Folks who want a large data set to work with.

Examples of past stories completed include:

- Beth Secor: Wrote and full tested a scraper service to pull jobs from Authentic Jobs [PR](https://github.com/LookingForMe/lookingfor/pull/51)
- Penney Garrett: Implemented Travis CI so that LookingFor now has continuous integration
[PR](https://github.com/LookingForMe/lookingfor/pull/50)
- John Slota: Set up a background worker and cron job to run our job scraper daily [PR](https://github.com/LookingForMe/lookingfor/pull/44)

### BoxTrot:Prime

- **What You’ll Do:** Work on a team to set up a React front end for the existing lookingFor Rails application.
- **Good Option For:** Folks unsure if they want to target Rails or JavaScript heavy jobs. Folks who want experience in client-side development.

### Fecho

- **What You’ll Do:** Work on a team on evaluating an existing, out of date [rails application](https://github.com/turingschool-projects/mentorSHIP), cutting scope and do a rebuild in a JavaScript. The existing application was built for connecting and working with Mentors at Turing.
- **Good Option For:** Folks who want to learn server side JavaScript. Folks who want experience reviewing legacy code. Folks who want consulting style experience in cutting scope/features on projects.

### Whiskey Tango

  -  **What You’ll Do:** Work on an Independent Study project, report progress in daily standup.
  -  **Good Option For:** Folks who have a passion project and feel they can stay motivated during a week or two.
  - [Project Spec](./independent_study_project.markdown)
  -  **Special Notes:** To do an independent study, you will need to get the idea approved by instructors.

Examples of past independent studies include:
 - Steve Olson: Built a [React Native IOS app](https://github.com/SteveOscar/Ramble_App) that displays the currency and expense data generated by his Ramble Map project.
 - Brant Wellman: De-coupled the basic 3D Engine code of his and Aaron's Gametime project from the actual gameplay code and published it into it's [own repo](https://github.com/brantwellman/3D-graphics-engine) with an in-depth companion [blog post](http://www.co-de-pendency.com/creating-a-3d-engine-the-setup-and-rendering-points/).
 - Beth Sebian: Worked on her [Police Data Tracker](https://github.com/bethsebian/police_data_tracker) app
 - Hector Huertas: Built and deployed a basic [Phoenix app](https://github.com/hectorhuertas/colabora_api)  

# The Fine Print

You'll be expected to follow the following workflow:
  - Track your hours and work/study 8 hours per day
  - Attend team stand up daily or let your team know if you need to skip and provide a detailed stand up message
  - Write about your experience in a blog post
  - Actively participate in the PR process - i.e. monitor and comment on PRs that your team members submit, respond to PR reviews from teammates, instructors and mentors.

Self study and classes that you attend count towards your 8 daily hours (as long as it is relevant to the work you're doing). All classes the next two weeks will be tagged with required or optional, depending on the team you choose.
