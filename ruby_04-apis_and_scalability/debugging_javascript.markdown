### Goals

By the end of this lesson, you will know/be able to:

* use `debugger` and `console` to peek into your JavaScript code in action
* be familiar with helpful features of Chrome's developer tools


### Intro

Client-side JavaScript has a lot of ways it can go horribly, horribly wrong. For starters, Browsers execute JavaScript with different engines, and not all interpretations are exactly the same.

Luckily, browsers give us some excellent tools for debugging client-side JavaScript.
