# The 'Job Profiling' Assignment

### List 5 companies you might want to apply for:
  - 2 companies you think you'd like to work for
  - 2 companies you don't really want to work for but that have a job posting somewhere you'd like to live
  - 1 dream company (BaseCamp, Funny or Die, Github... somewhere it's hard to get hired but wouldn't that be cool, eh?)

Don't say which is which though - just list 5.

### For each company, answer the following questions:

- List any Turing/gSchool/Hungry Academy grads that work there
- List anyone else you know that works there
- Link to the company's Github page(s)
  - List any open source projects actively maintained (have commits in the last 6 months)
- List the tech stack of the company
  - You can find the tech stack in a few different ways
    - Find their current and past job postings
    - Look around their Github page
    - Read through their blog posts
    - Look at the LinkedIn profiles or Twitter pages or Meetup Profiles of current employees
- Divide the tech stack into:
  - tech you've worked with
  - tech you're familiar with
  - tech you know almost nothing about
- List any meetups and events they have recently or will soon sponsor
  - You can figure this out for searching for the company on eventbrite, meetup.com, reading through their blog and their twitter feed, etc.
- List any technical interview information you can find about the company
  - Find the company on GlassDoor
  - Try googling 'Company Name Technical Interview Questions'
- List 'pros' and 'cons' of working for this Company
  - e.g. Pros: They're in the green energy field / Cons: They have bad reviews on Glassdoor
- What is your next step to pursue working at this company?

### Next Steps

Spend some time researching and reaching out to the companies you profiled above. Study up on some of technologies that you are fuzzy on in their tech stack. Work on your applications and submit as many as you feel appropriate.

## Wrap Up

Once you have a profile on five companies, you're armed with a lot of different ways to get them to notice you. You may also find that a company you were 'meh' about is actually sounding better and better the more you learn about it.
