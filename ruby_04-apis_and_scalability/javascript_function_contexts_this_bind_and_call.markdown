### Function Context -- What is `this`

Goals:

* Understand the various rules governing the behavior of the
`this` keyword in javascript
* Understand the precedence of these rules
* Understand the difference between function definition context
and invocation context

To cover these topics, we'll be walking through the issues
covered in this [MDN Tutorial on this](https://github.com/worace/advanced-js-fundamentals-ck/blob/gh-pages/tutorials/02-functions/03-what-is-this.md)

The main priorities are to cover the various precedence rules
as well as call, apply, and bind. This would take you through
[this point](https://github.com/worace/advanced-js-fundamentals-ck/blob/gh-pages/tutorials/02-functions/03-what-is-this.md#explicitly-setting-context-with-bind) in the
tutorial.
